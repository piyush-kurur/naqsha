[![Build Staus][travis-status]][travis-naqsha]

Naqsha is a Haskell library to work with maps and related data. We
plan to support various operations on points, trails and other map
related objects. We also plan to support reading, writing and
generating various standard data file format.

The word naqsha, or more accurately naqshA (नक़्शा), means a map or a
sketch.
