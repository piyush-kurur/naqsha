Naqsha is a Haskell library to work with geospatial data types. The
goal of this library is to provide fast and high level access to
various operations in the geospatial setting like distance
calculations, azimuth etc. Due to the very nature of the geometry on
the surface of the globe, many of these basic tasks have multiple
algorithms based on criteria like speed of computation and
accuracy. We would like to provide all such algorithms in this
package.

The word naqsha, or more accurately naqshA (नक़्शा), means a map or a
sketch.
